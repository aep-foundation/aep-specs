# AEP Test Vectors

This directory contains deterministic test vectors for the currently published
AEP Internet-Draft set.

The initial vector set should cover:

| Category                | Purpose                                                                                                                                          | Draft Coverage                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Inspect document        | Validate required fields, command advertisement, grant type advertisement, `did:web`, HTTP binding configuration, and extension discovery shape. | Core                          |
| Client assertion JWT    | Validate JOSE header fields, JWT claim fields, `aud`, `op`, `iat`, `exp`, and `jti` requirements.                                                | Core                          |
| Error response          | Validate AEP Problem Details shape and stable error codes.                                                                                       | Core                          |
| Idempotency             | Validate safe retry shape and idempotency conflict behavior.                                                                                     | Core                          |
| Enroll request/response | Validate minimal enrollment request and response shape.                                                                                          | Core                          |
| Status response         | Validate enrolled identity status response shape.                                                                                                | Core                          |
| Grant/Revoke request    | Validate shared Grant and Revoke request fields, including revoke-all behavior.                                                                  | Core plus credential profiles |
| OAuth Bearer credential | Validate OAuth Bearer Grant response, presentation syntax, expiry, scopes, and Revoke shape.                                                     | OAuth Bearer                  |
| API-key credential      | Validate API-key Grant response, API-key value syntax, header selection, expiry, scopes, and Revoke shape.                                       | API-key                       |
| Basic credential        | Validate Basic Grant response, generated username/password constraints, Basic presentation syntax, expiry, scopes, and Revoke shape.             | Basic                         |

## File Layout

Vectors use one directory per category:

```text
test-vectors/
  inspect/
  client-assertion/
  errors/
  idempotency/
  enroll/
  status/
  grant-revoke/
  credentials/
    oauth-bearer/
    api-key/
    basic/
```

Each vector file is JSON. File names use lowercase hyphenated identifiers:

```text
<category>/<vector-id>.json
```

## Vector Format

Each vector has this top-level shape:

```json
{
  "id": "inspect-minimal-http",
  "title": "Minimal HTTP Inspect document",
  "description": "A Service advertising the baseline HTTP binding and current credential profiles.",
  "drafts": [
    "draft-kavian-agent-enrollment-protocol-01"
  ],
  "category": "inspect",
  "applies_to": ["agent", "service"],
  "profile": "core-http",
  "input": {},
  "expected": {}
}
```

Required fields:

| Field         | Requirement                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`          | Lowercase hyphenated vector identifier.                      |
| `title`       | Short human-readable name.                                   |
| `description` | One- or two-sentence explanation of the behavior under test. |
| `drafts`      | Draft identifiers covered by the vector.                     |
| `category`    | Vector category.                                             |
| `applies_to`  | Array containing `agent`, `service`, or both.                |
| `profile`     | `core-http`, `oauth-bearer`, `api-key`, or `basic`.          |
| `input`       | Test input object.                                           |
| `expected`    | Expected output or validation result object.                 |

## Validation Rules

A vector validator should check at least:

- JSON parseability.
- File path matches `category` and `id`.
- `id` uses lowercase hyphenated syntax.
- `drafts` contains only published AEP draft identifiers.
- `category` is one of the known vector categories.
- `applies_to` contains only known roles.
- `profile` is one of the known profiles.
- `input` and `expected` are JSON objects.

The validator should not require live network access. Network-dependent checks
belong in the future conformance harness, not in static vector validation.

Run static vector validation with:

```sh
make -C ietf check-vectors
```
