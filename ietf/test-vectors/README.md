# AEP Test Vectors

This directory contains deterministic test vectors for the currently published
AEP Internet-Draft set.

The initial vector set should cover:

| Category                | Purpose                                                                                                                                                             | Draft Coverage                |

## File Layout

Vectors use one directory per category:

```text
test-vectors/
  caching/
  claims/
  client-assertion/
  credentials/
    api-key/
    basic/
    oauth-bearer/
  enroll/
  errors/
  grant-revoke/
  idempotency/
  inspect/
  openapi/
  platform/
  protected-resource/
  status/
```

Each vector file is JSON. File names use lowercase hyphenated identifiers:

```text
<category>/<vector-id>.json
```

## Vector Format

Each vector has this top-level shape:

```json
{
  "id": "inspect-minimal-http",
  "title": "Minimal HTTP Inspect document",
  "description": "A Service advertising the baseline HTTP binding and current credential profiles.",
  "drafts": [
    "draft-kavian-agent-enrollment-protocol-03"
  ],
  "category": "inspect",
  "applies_to": ["agent", "service"],
  "profile": "core-http",
  "input": {},
  "expected": {}
}
```

Required fields:

| Field         | Requirement                                                                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | Lowercase hyphenated vector identifier.                                                   |
| `title`       | Short human-readable name.                                                                |
| `description` | One- or two-sentence explanation of the behavior under test.                              |
| `drafts`      | Draft identifiers covered by the vector.                                                  |
| `category`    | Vector category.                                                                          |
| `applies_to`  | Array containing `agent`, `service`, or both.                                             |
| `profile`     | `core-http`, `claims`, `platform-hosted-identity`, `oauth-bearer`, `api-key`, or `basic`. |
| `input`       | Test input object.                                                                        |
| `expected`    | Expected output or validation result object.                                              |

## Validation Rules

A vector validator should check at least:

- JSON parseability.
- File path matches `category` and `id`.
- `id` uses lowercase hyphenated syntax.
- `drafts` contains only published AEP draft identifiers.
- `category` is one of the known vector categories.
- `applies_to` contains only known roles.
- `profile` is one of the known profiles.
- `input` and `expected` are JSON objects.
- Claims vectors include positive and negative value-shape cases and
  negotiation compatibility cases.

The validator should not require live network access. Network-dependent checks
belong in the future conformance harness, not in static vector validation.

Run static vector validation with:

```sh
make -C ietf check-vectors
```
